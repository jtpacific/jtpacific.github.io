Hello! I am an NRSA Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Maya Henry](https://slhs.utexas.edu/research/aphasia-research-treatment-lab) and [Alex Huth](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huth/). Previously I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin and my B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Harvard University.

My research focuses on modeling and decoding brain responses during language processing, and understanding how language relates to other cognitive processes such as vision. I am also interested in the clinical applications and [societal implications](https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/08/brain-decoders-mind-reading-research-ethics-privacy/) of brain decoding technology. Outside of research I enjoy disc golfing and playing the drums.
